# Matchain-Showroom-Template
Template for showrooms of media like the game NFT assets and news. Its a simple tool for new developers to build a way to communicate news and show media for their users, in a fast and simple way.

# ADVICE:
This is designed in a simple way so you can recognize each component fast, we will provide mock-ups with our way to design this in different styles so you can use it as reference for inspiration.

# LICENCE
This was originally licensed under MIT, but we think since our vission its to fully commit our skills to open source projects, we need to ask users to license their modifications or copies in the same way, so we changed it to GNU GPLv3

# Features
The website its simple: 
-There is a banner for news, that changes with the top buttons.
-There are 4 buttons with 4 gifs ( in a folder called Images inside componentes ), gifs triggers on hover, the buttons are for redirect to other sites, social media or apps.
-The is a mapping of an JSON to display multiple cards, to show the NFTÂ´s, this list has no limit, you just need to modify the JSON in src/data the correct way to add or delete them. The cards has a hover to show title, artist, and description of each one.

This repo is the result of multiple contributors fans of GNU software, fervient defenders of the free software and open source projects, feel free to use it in any way.
